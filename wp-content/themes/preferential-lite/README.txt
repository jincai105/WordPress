    Child Theme - For Theme Modifications
-------------------------------------------------------

The Preferential Lite theme includes a premade child theme that you can use
if you need to make modifications (custom changes) to any code within the theme
files. Simply install the child theme and activate it after you install the 
parent theme of Preferential Lite. 

The child theme (preferentiallite-child.zip) can be found in a folder named "child-theme"
and is located in your Prefential lite theme files.

For more information about child themes:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes 

If you plan to make "only" CSS changes to your theme, then you can use the Edit CSS in
Jetpack (if using this plugin) or you can use a plugin like Simple Custom CSS
which lets you customize your theme's CSS as a separate file that won't be overwritten
when you update your theme.
